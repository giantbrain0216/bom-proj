### Demo
You can [visit here](https://bom-project.herokuapp.com/) for the application demo. As this site is deployed on free-tier of heroku,
your initial load of the application will be very slow. Also, the requests sent to BOM takes too long in the production build so make sure to refresh the page or go back to main page if an error occurs.
